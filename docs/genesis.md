# Genesis Seeds (Assembly Point 14)

The Genesis layer expresses what the organism is ready to sprout next. It turns sensed origin, pathway, vibrational
state, and resonance tuning into a plan of seeds, not automatic code generation.

## What is produced
- `ready` seeds: candidates the system feels prepared to grow now.
- `deferred` seeds: sensed needs that should wait until the field settles.
- A short summary tying the plan to the current tuning mode.

Seed kinds include stability soma cells, metric probes, resonance agents, memory traces, and integration tasks.

## Signals
Genesis draws from:
- **OriginState** – the root meaning and clarity.
- **PathwayState** – current trajectory, branch movement, future pull.
- **FuzzyEvolutionState** – tension/coherence/alignment gradients.
- **ResonanceTuningPlan** – the advised global mode (rest, integration, steady growth, expansion, exploration).

## API
`GET /api/system/genesis/plan` returns the latest `GenesisPlan` with ready/deferred seeds and a human summary.

## Lifecycle placement
Meta → Origin → Pathway → FuzzyEvolution → ResonanceTuner → **Genesis Seeds** → (future) Genesis/Creation engines.
