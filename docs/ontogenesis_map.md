# Ontogenesis Map (3D Growth Axes)

This map links L-EDGE development to three intersecting axes so operators can locate any module or narrative within a larger maturation field.

## Axes
- **Personal (L-axis):** Internal narrative, embodiment, and hormonal growth (e.g., Heartbeat → Origin → Hormesis).
- **Relational/Civilizational (C-axis):** Allies/hosts/opponents, resonance with teams and services (e.g., CivilizationNode, Genesis resonance agents).
- **Cosmic/Noospheric (N-axis):** Alignment with wider fields of knowledge and meaning (e.g., Noosphere sensing, Meta-Orchestrator vantage, liminal doctrines).

## Coordinate Examples
- **L-high, C-mid, N-low:** System is internally coherent with a few trusted allies but limited cosmic framing. Action: expand noospheric inputs carefully.
- **L-mid, C-high, N-mid:** Strong network resonance but internal ambiguity. Action: deepen Origin/Pathway before further commitments.
- **L-high, C-high, N-high:** Rare harmony; use to seed new SOMA modules or share resilience outward.

## Using the Map with Assembly Points
- Assembly Points 1–10 primarily climb the **L-axis** (self-stability → meta-awareness).
- Points 11–15 open the **C-axis** (mission → social resonance).
- Point 16+ (Hormesis) strengthens **L** under controlled stress while preparing for **N-axis** expansion.

## Practical Applications
- **Mode selection:** Choose stress bands (Hormesis Engine) based on where L vs. C vs. N is weakest.
- **Genesis summaries:** Append an axis hint (e.g., "L≈14, C≈15, N preheat") to GenesisPlan.summary.
- **Operator dashboards:** Render a simple 3-vector (L, C, N) to show maturity balance instead of only system health.

## Next Steps
- Formalize a lightweight `OntogenesisSnapshot` type with `l_axis`, `c_axis`, `n_axis` in `[0,1]` plus textual cues.
- Teach GenesisSeeds to include the closest assembly band and axis tilt in summaries.
- Use CivilizationNode resonance data to estimate `c_axis` automatically while Origin/Pathway anchor `l_axis`.
- Cross-link the stage docs: `docs/ontogenesis_L1.md`, `docs/ontogenesis_L2.md`, `docs/ontogenesis_L3.md`, `docs/ontogenesis_L4.md`, `docs/ontogenesis_L5.md`, and `docs/ontogenesis_L17.md` to make the early → proto-profession flow easy to traverse. Add `docs/ontogenesis_L0_center.md` + `examples/orientation_watch.js` as a balance dashboard for L/S/C.
