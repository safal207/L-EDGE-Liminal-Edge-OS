# Genesis Seeds

The Genesis layer sketches which "seeds" the organism is ready to sprout next. It does **not** auto-create code;
it produces a plan describing small cells, probes, or integration tasks that fit the current state.

## How it works
- Observes **Origin**, **Pathway**, **FuzzyEvolution**, and **ResonanceTuner**.
- Uses soft heuristics to propose `ready` seeds and `deferred` seeds.
- Seeds include stability soma cells, metric probes, resonance agents, memory traces, and integration tasks.

## Why
Genesis Seeds articulate readiness: instead of impulsively spawning modules, the system states why a seed matters,
whether it should wait, and what shape it should take. This anchors future growth in sensed intent and current vibrational mode.
