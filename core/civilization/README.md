# Civilization Node

Resonant Civilization Node tracks how L-EDGE relates to nearby humans, teams, services, and other agents. It keeps a lightweight list of agents with their resonance level, trust, and tension, plus an aggregated global mode that reflects how open the organism is to external connections.

This node does not try to be a CRM or contact book. Instead it paints a living map of resonance vs. friction so the operator can sense when to open or close external channels.

The node can start with seed agents (e.g., the core operator) and integrates signals from FuzzyEvolution, the ResonanceTuner, and Genesis plans to update its picture. When Genesis proposes resonance agents, the node treats them as potential connectors to the wider field.
