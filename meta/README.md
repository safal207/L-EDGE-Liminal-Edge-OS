# Meta / Observer Layer

The MetaEngine acts as a sentinel that observes trends across all organs (homeostasis, reflex, sleep, replay, transmutation, intent) and produces a meta-level awareness snapshot. It tracks stress trends, reflex frequencies, replay relief, and coherence to surface anomalies and high-level adaptation phases.

Capabilities:
- Collects observations every heartbeat and keeps a bounded history.
- Detects rising stress, reflex spikes, weak transmutation signals, and low recovery after sleep.
- Computes coherence and adaptation phase, feeding a summary back into `systemContext.meta` and the public APIs.
- Exposes lightweight types and pattern helpers for future forecasting layers.
